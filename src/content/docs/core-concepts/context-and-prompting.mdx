## Adding explicit context

To get better results from Kiro, you can add context to your prompts. Kiro supports several context types, including files and images.

Adding context helps Kiro understand your project structure, coding patterns, and requirements more precisely.

## Creating a todo list app

In this workshop, we'll build a **todo list application** with a Python Flask backend and Vue.js frontend. Let's start with the initial prompt.

<Steps>

1. **Enter your prompt**

   In the Kiro chat, type the following prompt:

   ```text title="Initial prompt"
   Create a todo list application. This application is API first, using backend with Python running on Flask. The frontend is using Vue JS.
   ```

2. **Choose your approach**

   You can either select **Spec** to go directly into spec-driven development, or refine the prompt first using **Vibe** mode. We'll explore both approaches in the next section.

</Steps>
