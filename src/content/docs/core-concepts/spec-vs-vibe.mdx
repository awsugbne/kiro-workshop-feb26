title: Spec vs Vibe Coding
description: Understand Kiro's two coding modes and when to use each one.

import { Tabs, TabItem, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Kiro offers two distinct modes for building applications. Understanding when to use each is key to getting the most out of the IDE.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Spec (Recommended)">
    **Spec-driven development** is Kiro's recommended approach. When you provide a prompt in Spec mode, Kiro creates three structured documents:

    1. **Requirements** — User stories and acceptance criteria in EARS notation
    2. **Design** — Technical architecture, sequence diagrams, and implementation considerations
    3. **Implementation Plan** — A detailed task list with discrete, trackable tasks

    Use Spec mode when you want a structured, reviewable development process.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Vibe">
    **Vibe coding** is a more freeform mode. It's great for:

    - Rapid exploration and testing
    - Refining prompts before using Spec mode
    - Quick prototyping
    - Building when requirements are unclear

    As we'll see later, you can combine both — use Vibe to refine your prompt, then pass the result to Spec mode.

## Model selection and Autopilot

- **Model selection** — You can choose from available models, though **Auto** is recommended. Kiro will optimise which model to use. Model selection influences both results and credit usage.
- **Autopilot mode** — An autonomous execution feature where Kiro can make multiple code changes, run commands, and make architectural decisions across a codebase to complete complex tasks with minimal human intervention.

<Aside type="tip">
Using the **Auto** model setting lets Kiro pick the best model for each task, balancing quality and credit usage.
