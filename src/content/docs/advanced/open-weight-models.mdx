Kiro supports **open weight models** alongside Claude, giving you flexibility to match model capabilities to your tasks while managing credit costs.

## Available Models

### DeepSeek v3.2

| | |
|---|---|
| **Credit Multiplier** | 0.25x |
| **Architecture** | Sparse Mixture-of-Experts |
| **Strengths** | Multi-step tool calling, maintaining state across long sessions |

**Best for:**
- Building agents and complex debugging
- Agentic workflows requiring persistent state
- Multi-file refactoring sessions

### MiniMax 2.1

| | |
|---|---|
| **Credit Multiplier** | 0.15x |
| **Specialisation** | Multilingual programming |
| **Languages** | Rust, Java, Go, C++, Kotlin, TypeScript, JavaScript |

**Best for:**
- Teams working across multiple programming languages
- Frontend development (web, Android, iOS)
- UI code generation

### Qwen3 Coder Next

| | |
|---|---|
| **Credit Multiplier** | 0.05x |
| **Architecture** | 80B sparse MoE (3B active parameters) |
| **Context** | 256K tokens |
| **Performance** | 70%+ on SWE-Bench Verified |

**Best for:**
- Long agentic CLI sessions
- Budget-conscious development
- Quick iterations and boilerplate generation

## Choosing the Right Model

| Task | Recommended Model | Why |
|------|------------------|-----|
| Quick code fixes | Qwen3 Coder Next | Lowest cost, fast responses |
| Complex debugging | DeepSeek v3.2 | Maintains context across long sessions |
| UI generation | MiniMax 2.1 | Strong at frontend code patterns |
| Multi-language projects | MiniMax 2.1 | Excellent across many languages |
| Spec-driven development | Claude (Auto) | Best for structured planning |
| Code review | Claude Opus | Highest reasoning quality |

<Aside type="tip">
Use **Auto** mode to let Kiro intelligently select models based on the task. For specific needs, manually select from the model dropdown.

## Credit Efficiency Strategies

1. **Use Qwen3 for routine work** — Boilerplate, simple refactors, documentation
2. **Reserve Claude for planning** — Requirements, design, complex architecture
3. **Use DeepSeek for debugging** — When you need persistent context
4. **Use MiniMax for frontend** — UI components, styling, responsive layouts

## How to Select Models

### In the IDE

Click the model selector in the chat panel and choose from the dropdown list.

### In the CLI

```bash
# Specify model explicitly
kiro chat --model deepseek-v3

# Or use in agent mode
kiro agent --model qwen3-coder-next "Generate unit tests for auth module"
```

## Technical Details

- **Inference Region**: AWS US East (N. Virginia)
- **Availability**: Free and paid users with Google, GitHub, or AWS Builder ID
- **Support Status**: Experimental (stability may vary)

<Aside type="caution">
Open weight models are marked as experimental. While they perform well for many tasks, Claude remains the recommended choice for critical work requiring highest reliability.
