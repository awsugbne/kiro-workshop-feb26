title: Kiro CLI Workflows
description: Use Kiro from the command line for autonomous agents, CI/CD integration, and advanced workflows.

While this workshop focuses on Kiro IDE, **Kiro CLI** offers powerful capabilities for developers who prefer terminal-based workflows or need to integrate Kiro into automated pipelines.

## Why Use the CLI?

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Autonomous Agents">
    The CLI excels at running **autonomous agent sessions** — long-running tasks where Kiro works independently with minimal intervention:

    - Complex refactoring across multiple files
    - Codebase-wide migrations
    - Extended debugging sessions
    - Multi-step feature implementation
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="CI/CD Integration">
    Integrate Kiro into your development pipelines:

    - Automated code review on pull requests
    - Pre-commit spec validation
    - Documentation generation
    - Test generation for new features
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Scripting">
    Script Kiro for repeatable tasks:

    - Batch processing of code changes
    - Standardised project setup
    - Automated documentation updates
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Getting Started with CLI

<Steps>

1. **Install Kiro CLI**

   Download from [kiro.dev](https://kiro.dev) — the CLI is included with the IDE installation, or can be installed separately.

2. **Authenticate**

   ```bash
   kiro auth login
   ```

   This opens a browser for AWS Builder ID authentication.

3. **Start a chat session**

   ```bash
   kiro chat
   ```

   Opens an interactive chat session in your terminal.

4. **Run autonomous tasks**

   ```bash
   kiro agent "Refactor the authentication module to use JWT tokens"
   ```

   Starts an autonomous agent that works through the task independently.

</Steps>

## Model Selection in CLI

Just like the IDE, you can select models in the CLI:

```bash
# Use a specific model
kiro chat --model claude-opus-4

# Use open weight models for cost efficiency
kiro chat --model qwen3-coder-next
```

<Aside type="tip">
For long agentic sessions, consider **Qwen3 Coder Next** (0.05x credits) which supports 256K context — ideal for working across large codebases.
</Aside>

## Code Intelligence

The CLI includes powerful code analysis features:

```bash
# Analyse codebase structure
kiro analyze

# Generate documentation
kiro docs generate

# Find related code
kiro search "authentication flow"
```

Learn more in the [Code Intelligence documentation](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/code-intelligence/).

## Combining IDE and CLI

A powerful workflow combines both tools:

1. **Plan in IDE** — Use Spec mode to generate requirements and design
2. **Execute via CLI** — Run autonomous agents for implementation
3. **Review in IDE** — Use inline chat and checkpointing for refinement

<Aside type="note">
The CLI uses the same authentication and credits as the IDE. Your steering docs, hooks, and MCP configurations apply to both.
