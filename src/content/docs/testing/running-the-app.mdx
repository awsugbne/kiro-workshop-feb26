## Running the application

<Steps>

1. **Start both frontend and backend**

   Run the Flask backend and Vue.js frontend in separate terminals.

   The frontend application connects to the backend APIs to manage todos.

2. **Test the todo list**

   Add a new todo item to verify the application works end-to-end.

   The frontend interacts with the backend APIs — the full stack is working!

</Steps>
