## Using inline chat

Kiro's **Inline Chat** feature allows you to interact with Kiro directly in the editor, without opening a separate chat panel. This is useful for quick code modifications or asking questions about the current code context.

To activate Inline Chat, press **⌘ + I** (Mac) or **Ctrl + I** (Windows/Linux) while in the editor. You can select code and request modifications, ask questions, or trigger spec changes directly.

## Context with the # symbol

Within any Kiro chat input, the **#** symbol acts as a context provider. When you type `#`, an autocomplete menu appears, allowing you to quickly reference:

- Specific **files**
- **Folders**
- Predefined **steering files**

<Aside type="tip">
Inline Chat is great for small, focused changes. For larger features or structural changes, use the full Spec workflow to maintain structured documentation.

Congratulations! You've completed the Kiro IDE Workshop. You now know how to:

- Set up and configure Kiro IDE
- Use both Spec and Vibe coding modes
- Generate structured specs (requirements, design, tasks)
- Configure steering docs, agent hooks, and MCP servers
- Execute tasks and handle confirmations
- Test, iterate, and use checkpointing
- Use inline chat for quick edits

Happy building!
