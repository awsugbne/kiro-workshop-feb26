Sometimes you'll encounter issues during development. Kiro provides a **Checkpointing** feature to help you recover.

## How checkpointing works

As Kiro modifies your codebase, it automatically creates **checkpoint markers**. These checkpoints help Kiro understand and rewind changes when something goes wrong.

You have two options when encountering issues:

1. **Work with Kiro to fix it** — Describe the problem in chat and let Kiro debug and resolve the issue.
2. **Restore to a checkpoint** — Click **Restore** to rewind to a previous known-good state.

<Aside type="tip">
Checkpointing is especially useful when a task produces unexpected results. Instead of manually undoing changes, you can restore to the state before the problematic task and try a different approach.
