## Choose Your Track

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Track 1: Foundations" icon="rocket">
		**Best for you if:**
		- You've heard about AI coding but haven't used Kiro yet
		- You haven't installed or configured Kiro before
		- You want guided setup and hands-on walkthrough

		**Start here:** [Welcome & Sign In](/kiro-workshop-feb26/getting-started/welcome-and-signin/)
	</Card>
	<Card title="Track 2: Builder" icon="setting">
		**Best for you if:**
		- You already build software or automation
		- You're comfortable with git, CLI, and debugging
		- You want to use Kiro in real workflows

		**Jump to:** [Configuring Kiro](/kiro-workshop-feb26/configuring/task-lists-and-steering/) or [CLI Workflows](/kiro-workshop-feb26/advanced/cli-workflows/)
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

<Aside type="tip">
**Quick decision:** Need help installing and getting started? → **Foundations**. Already building software and want leverage? → **Builder**.

## What you'll learn

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Spec-Driven Development" icon="document">
		Learn Kiro's structured approach: generate requirements, design documents, and implementation plans from a single prompt.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Vibe Coding" icon="rocket">
		Use Kiro's Vibe mode for rapid exploration and prompt refinement before switching to Spec mode for structured builds.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Steering Docs" icon="setting">
		Guide Kiro with persistent knowledge — coding standards, accessibility rules, and project conventions.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Agent Hooks & MCP" icon="puzzle">
		Automate workflows with event-driven hooks and extend Kiro's capabilities with MCP servers.

## Workshop overview

This workshop walks you through building a **todo list application** (Python Flask backend + Vue.js frontend) entirely within Kiro IDE. You'll experience the full spec-driven development workflow:

1. **Set up Kiro** — Sign in, explore the workspace, understand credits
2. **Learn the modes** — Spec vs Vibe coding, context, and model selection
3. **Generate specs** — Refine your prompt, generate requirements, design, and tasks
4. **Configure your workspace** — Steering docs, agent hooks, MCP servers
5. **Execute the build** — Run tasks, handle confirmations, verify completion
6. **Test & iterate** — Run the app, use checkpointing, iterate with updated specs
