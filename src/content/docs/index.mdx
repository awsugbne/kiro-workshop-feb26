## Workshop overview

This workshop walks you through building a **todo list application** (Python Flask backend + Vue.js frontend) entirely within Kiro IDE. You'll experience the full spec-driven development workflow:

1. **Set up Kiro** — Sign in, explore the workspace, understand credits
2. **Learn the modes** — Spec vs Vibe coding, context, and model selection
3. **Generate specs** — Refine your prompt, generate requirements, design, and tasks
4. **Configure your workspace** — Steering docs, agent hooks, MCP servers
5. **Execute the build** — Run tasks, handle confirmations, verify completion
6. **Test & iterate** — Run the app, use checkpointing, iterate with updated specs
