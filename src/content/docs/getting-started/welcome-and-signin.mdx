<Aside type="tip">
You'll need an **AWS Builder ID** to use Kiro. It's free to create — [sign up here](https://builder.aws.com/start?trk=c4ea046f-18ad-4d23-a1ac-cdd1267f942c&sc_channel=el) if you don't have one.
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. **Open Kiro and sign in with AWS Builder ID**

   When you first launch Kiro, you'll see the sign-in screen. Select **AWS Builder ID** as your sign-in option.
