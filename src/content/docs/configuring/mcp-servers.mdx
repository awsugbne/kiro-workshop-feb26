description: Extend Kiro's capabilities by connecting to MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol that standardises how applications provide context to LLMs. With MCP, Kiro can connect to various data sources and tools through MCP servers, extending its capabilities beyond built-in features. This allows Kiro to interact with databases, APIs, file systems, and other services in a standardised way.

## AWS MCP Servers

AWS provides **50+ MCP servers** for interacting with AWS services. Find the full catalog at [awslabs.github.io/mcp](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/).

## Configuring MCP Servers in Kiro

<Steps>

1. **Add MCP server configuration**

   To define MCP servers, add them as you normally would in any MCP client. The configuration follows the standard MCP format.

2. **Example configuration**

   Here's an example MCP server configuration for AWS Documentation:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "aws-docs": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"],
         "env": {
           "AWS_PROFILE": "default"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Kiro**

   After adding configuration, restart Kiro to load the new MCP servers.

</Steps>

## MCP vs Powers

For common use cases, consider using [Kiro Powers](/kiro-workshop-feb26/configuring/powers/) instead:

| Feature | MCP Servers | Powers |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Setup | Manual JSON config | One-click install |
| Includes | Tools only | Tools + Steering + Hooks |
| Flexibility | Full control | Pre-configured |
| Best for | Custom setups | Common workflows |

<Aside type="note">
Powers are built on MCP servers. If a Power exists for your use case, it's usually easier to install the Power. Use direct MCP configuration when you need custom setups or servers not available as Powers.
</Aside>

## Practical Example: Cost Estimation

With the **AWS Pricing MCP Server** configured, you can estimate costs before deploying:

```
"Estimate the monthly cost for running 3 t3.medium EC2 instances
with 100GB EBS storage each in ap-southeast-2"
```

Kiro will query current AWS pricing and provide a detailed cost breakdown.

- **MCP GitHub**: [github.com/awslabs/mcp](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp)
- **Community servers**: [promptz.dev](https://www.promptz.dev) hosts additional MCP configurations

With **Steering Docs**, **Agent Hooks**, **Powers**, and **MCP Servers** configured, Kiro is now equipped with the tools and knowledge it needs. Let's start executing the build tasks.
