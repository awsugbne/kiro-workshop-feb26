**Kiro Powers** are specialized add-ons that bundle MCP tools, steering files, and hooks into a single install. They give your agents specialized knowledge without overwhelming them with context — Powers activate dynamically based on your conversation, loading only relevant capabilities.

<Aside type="tip">
Powers are **free for all Kiro users** and require no additional configuration. Install with one click and start using immediately.
</Aside>

## How Powers Work

1. **One-click install** — Browse the catalog and install any Power instantly
2. **Context-aware activation** — Powers load automatically when relevant to your task
3. **Combine multiple Powers** — Use several Powers together for enhanced capabilities
4. **No context overload** — Only active Power capabilities are loaded into context

## Installing Powers

1. **Open the Powers catalog**

   Access Powers from the Kiro IDE menu or browse at [kiro.dev/powers](https://kiro.dev/powers/).

2. **Choose a Power**

    ```

    Kiro will:
    - Configure your build settings
    - Set up the deployment pipeline
    - Handle DNS and SSL automatically
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Supabase Backend">
    The **Supabase Power** helps you build full-stack apps:

    ```
    "Add user authentication with Supabase and create a profiles table"
    ```

    Kiro will:
    - Set up Supabase authentication
    - Create database migrations
    - Generate type-safe client code
  </TabItem>
